Latino men are often expected to be macho and strong, but sometimes we feel just like anyone else – depressed, sad, and hopeless. No one knows what it's like to be in our shoes, to feel like we have to put on a brave face all the time.

It's hard to explain what's causing our depression – it could be work, family, personal problems, or anything else that's going on in our lives. But whatever the reason, we feel like we can't escape it. We're stuck in this dark place, and it feels like there's no way out.
