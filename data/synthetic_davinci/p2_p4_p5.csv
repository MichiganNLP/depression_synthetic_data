Hey guys,

I'm feeling really down and stressed out right now and I wanted to share my story and see if anyone can relate.

I'm Hispanic and I live in a really tough neighborhood. There's a lot of crime and violence and it's really hard to feel safe. I'm also really struggling financially. I'm working two jobs but it's still not enough to make ends meet. I feel like I'm just barely getting by and it's really stressing me out.
